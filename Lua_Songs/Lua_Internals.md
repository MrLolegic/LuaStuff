<h1 align="center">Flowing With Lua</h1>

<h3 align="center">Introduction</h3>

"Lua, The Programming King" is a rap song that I, an 18-year-old British Lua programmer, created to showcase the power and versatility of Lua. My aim was to create an educational and entertaining piece of music that explains the benefits of Lua in a fun and catchy way.

The song consists of several verses and a chorus, each covering different aspects of Lua programming. The verses touch on the lightweight nature of Lua, its speed, ease of use, and various modules. The chorus ties everything together, emphasizing how Lua can be used in various applications like games and web development.

My hope is that "Lua, The Programming King" inspires people to learn Lua and utilize it in their projects. It was a labor of love, and I'm excited to share it with the world.

I'm Mr. Lolegic, I'm only 18,
But when it comes to coding, I'm like a machine.
I'm deep in Lua Internals, let me take you on a ride,
It's like exploring the ocean, with its currents and tides.

Lua Internals, it's like a puzzle,
I'll crack the code, no need to hustle.
I'll dive deep into the code,
And find the answers that were never told.

I've got the knowledge, I've got the skill,
I can make Lua do things that give you a thrill.
From memory management to garbage collection,
I've got it covered, with no hesitation.

And find the answers that were never told.

I'm from Croydon, but I'm not your average bloke,
I'm a programmer, and I love to code.
I'm always exploring, always learning,
I've got the passion, that keeps on burning.

Lua Internals, it's like a puzzle,
I'll crack the code, no need to hustle.
I'll dive deep into the code,
And find the answers that were never told.

I've got the techniques, I've got the tricks,
I can make Lua do things that make your head spin.
From function calls to table manipulation,
I'll make it work, with no hesitation.

And find the answers that were never told.

Let me show you the secrets of the Lua source,
It's a journey that'll take you off course.
From the stack to the virtual machine,
It's a world that's waiting to be seen.

I'll show you how the stack works its magic,
Pushing and popping, it's no tragic.
From local variables to upvalues,
I'll teach you how to use them to your advantage.

Let's talk about the bytecode and its structure,
How it's read and executed without rupture.
From opcodes to operands,
It's a language that's simply grand.

But what about the garbage collector,
How it manages memory like a protector.
Mark and sweep, it's like a broom,
Cleaning up the mess without a gloom.

And let's not forget about metatables,
They're like tables with special abilities.
From operator overloading to object orientation,
They'll make your code shine with perfection.

Lua Internals, it's like a puzzle,
I'll crack the code, no need to hustle.
I'll dive deep into the code,

I'll take you on a journey through Lua's internals,
It's a world that's full of potential.
From C API to standard libraries,
It's a language that's simply extraordinary.

Let's talk about the call stack,
How it manages function calls without any lack.
From frames to closures,
It's a feature that's simply a treasure.

And what about Lua's table structure,
It's a world that's full of adventure.
From keys to values,
It's a feature that's simply genius.

But what about LuaJIT,
It's like Lua on steroids without any limit.
From just-in-time compilation to tracing,
It's a feature that's simply amazing.
